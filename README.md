# TicTacToe
This was a project for my software engineering class in which i created a program that would have a client side and a server side. The client side featured a GUI that the user would interact with to register, login, and play the game. The server side would feature an Game AI that would play the user and a database to store the user information (name, password, games won, etc...). The database i was using was My SQL. The user and server instances would send serialized objects back and forth that would contain information about the game board, logins, etc...
